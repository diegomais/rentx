### Setting up the development environment

The project is developed using Git. Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

The project can be built with npm or Yarn, so choose one of the following approaches if you don't have any installed on your system.

- **npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general. [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegomais/rentx.git
